# PXF GitHub Actions CI/CD for Apache/Cloudberry

This document describes the GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline that replaces the previous Concourse-based system for PXF integration with Apache/Cloudberry Database.

## Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow provides automated testing, building, and deployment of PXF (Platform Extension Framework) adapted for Apache/Cloudberry Database, replacing the previous Greenplum-focused Concourse pipelines.

## Workflow Files

### Main CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

The primary workflow that runs on every push and pull request:

**Jobs:**
- `build-matrix`: Builds PXF components across multiple OS and Java versions
- `smoke-tests`: Runs basic functionality tests
- `integration-tests`: Tests with Hadoop components (HDFS, Hive)
- `security-scan`: Performs security vulnerability scanning
- `code-quality`: Runs linting and code quality checks
- `deploy`: Handles artifact deployment (main branch only)

**Key Features:**
- Multi-platform support (Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04)
- Multiple Java versions (8, 11)
- Caching for Maven, Gradle, and Go dependencies
- Artifact generation (TAR, DEB packages)
- Security scanning with SARIF uploads

### Performance Testing Workflow (`.github/workflows/performance.yml`)

Extended testing for performance and compatibility:

**Triggers:**
- Nightly schedule (2 AM UTC)
- Manual dispatch with configurable test types

**Jobs:**
- `performance-tests`: Runs performance benchmarks with different Hadoop configurations
- `stress-tests`: Executes stress testing scenarios
- `compatibility-matrix`: Tests multiple version combinations
- `generate-test-report`: Aggregates results into comprehensive reports

## Key Adaptations for Apache/Cloudberry

### Database Integration Changes

1. **Greenplum ‚Üí Cloudberry Migration:**
   - Uses PostgreSQL 14 as base (Cloudberry is PostgreSQL-based)
   - Adapts extension build process for Cloudberry compatibility
   - Modifies environment variables and paths

2. **Extension Compatibility:**
   - External table extension builds with PostgreSQL infrastructure
   - FDW extension may need Cloudberry-specific adaptations
   - Graceful handling of build failures during migration

3. **Configuration Adaptations:**
   - Modified `GPHOME` to point to PostgreSQL installation
   - Adjusted `PXF_HOME` and `PG_CONFIG` paths
   - Updated user and database setup for Cloudberry

### Resource Optimization for Public CI

1. **Limited Resource Usage:**
   - Selective test execution based on labels
   - Parallel job matrix with fail-fast disabled
   - Appropriate timeouts for different job types

2. **Artifact Management:**
   - Short retention periods (7-30 days)
   - Selective artifact upload based on primary builds
   - Compressed packaging for efficiency

3. **Conditional Execution:**
   - Integration tests only on labeled PRs or main branch
   - Performance tests limited to authorized repositories
   - Stress tests only on manual dispatch

## Comparison with Original Concourse Pipeline

### Features Retained
- ‚úÖ Multi-component builds (external-table, FDW, CLI, server)
- ‚úÖ Unit and integration testing
- ‚úÖ Package creation (TAR, DEB)
- ‚úÖ Hadoop ecosystem testing (HDFS, Hive, HBase)
- ‚úÖ Security scanning
- ‚úÖ Performance testing (scheduled)

### Features Adapted
- üîÑ **Database Platform**: Greenplum ‚Üí Apache/Cloudberry
- üîÑ **Cloud Storage**: S3/MinIO/GCS ‚Üí Simplified local testing
- üîÑ **Container Strategy**: Custom Docker images ‚Üí GitHub Actions runners
- üîÑ **Resource Management**: Enterprise CI ‚Üí Public CI limitations

### Features Simplified/Removed
- ‚ùå Multi-node Hadoop clusters (resource intensive)
- ‚ùå Enterprise cloud integrations (requires credentials)
- ‚ùå Complex multi-datacenter deployments
- ‚ùå Proprietary Greenplum-specific features
- ‚ùå RPM packaging (focused on DEB for Ubuntu/Debian)

## Usage Instructions

### Running Tests Locally

1. **Prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y build-essential maven postgresql-14 postgresql-server-dev-14
   ```

2. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   export GPHOME=/usr/lib/postgresql/14
   export PXF_HOME=/usr/local/pxf
   export PG_CONFIG=/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin/pg_config
   ```

3. **Build PXF:**
   ```bash
   make clean
   make all
   ```

### Triggering Workflows

1. **Automatic Triggers:**
   - Push to main/master/develop branches
   - Pull request creation/updates
   - Nightly performance tests (2 AM UTC)

2. **Manual Triggers:**
   - Use "Actions" tab in GitHub repository
   - Select workflow and click "Run workflow"
   - Configure parameters for performance tests

### Artifact Access

Built artifacts are available in the Actions tab:
